### :heavy_exclamation_mark: DO NOT WRITE TESTS FOR AZURE FUNCTIONS USING JEST, USE POSTMAN INSTEAD.

## Testing Azure Functions:

For each azure function, there is a `<filename>.postman.json` file in the main testing folder.

Load thos files in postman, and you will be able to test your azure functions this way.

## Testing Regular Helper Functions:

Use jest to test your functions.
